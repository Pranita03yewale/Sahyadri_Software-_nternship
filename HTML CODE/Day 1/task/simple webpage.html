    <p>Once upon a time, a ferocious lion lived in a dense African jungle. The lion always took his afternoon nap under
        the shade of a big tree in the bushes. One day, a small playful mouse saw the lion and decided to investigate
        closer. The mouse found the lion's mane enticing and jumped on his head to play in the lion's dense mane. This
        annoyed the lion as he woke up from his slumber. He caught the mouse and roared at him for being a pest. The
        lion was about to crush the little mouse to death when the mouse began squeaking, pleading with the lion to
        spare his life. He told the lion that if he spares his life, the mouse will help him in return someday. The lion
        was amused at the mouse's words and decided to spare his life.</p>

    <p>One day when the lion was strolling through the jungle, he got caught in a hunter's net. The lion frantically
        tried to tear the net apart or bite through it. But, he was unsuccessful as his claws and teeth were not sharp
        enough to cut through the net. The lion begins to roar, pleading for help from anybody who might be passing by.
        The mouse who lived nearby heard the lion and rushed to help him.</p>

    <p>With his sharp teeth, the mouse nibbled through the net. He freed the lion, and both of them fled the place.
        After a while, they reached the spot where they first met, and the lion thanked the mouse immensely for his
        help. He confessed that he underestimated the mouse's offer before but now understood that everybody needs
        support at some point. Since then, both the lion and the mouse became best friends.</p>

    <strong>Moral Of The Story:</strong>
    <p>“A good deed never goes to waste. The kindness you show has a way of coming back to you in unexpected ways”.</p>
