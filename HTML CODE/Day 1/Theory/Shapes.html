    <h3>Area of Square : <i>side <sup>2</sup></i></h3>
    <H3>Information:</H3>
    <p>A square is a quadrilateral with four equal sides. There are many objects around us that are in the shape of a
        square. Each square shape is identified by its equal sides and its interior angles that are equal to 90Â°. Let us
        learn more about the properties of a square, its formulas, and its construction.</p>

    <h3>Area of Rectangle : <i>length*breadth</i></h3>
    <H3>Information:</H3>
    <p>A Rectangle is a four sided-polygon, having all the internal angles equal to 90 degrees. The two sides at each
        corner or vertex, meet at right angles. The opposite sides of the rectangle are equal in length which makes it
        different from a square.</p>
